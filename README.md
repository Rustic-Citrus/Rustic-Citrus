## About Me

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Harry, and I'm currently an amateur programmer with experience in Python and JavaScript, as well as a number of other languages, such as HTML, CSS, SQL and R. I also work with human languages, having taught English for over 7 years, and am fluent in Portuguese with an intermediate fluency in German.

## About My Work

I create applications that facilitate my life and the lives of others, and that hopefully provide value to the user. Sometimes, I am the only user, but if anyone is interested in my work, they're more than welcome to adapt it to suit their needs. After all, I code to create value, not to gain fame or recognition.
