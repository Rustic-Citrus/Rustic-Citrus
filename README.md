## About me

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Harry, and I'm currently a prospective Software Engineer with experience in Python, JavaScript and Java, as well as a number of other languages, including HTML, CSS, SQL and R. I also work with human languages, having taught English for over 7 years, and am fluent in Portuguese, with an intermediate proficiency in German.

## About my work

I create applications that solve real problems. I look to work with problems with which I have prior experience, such as in education or language-learning.
